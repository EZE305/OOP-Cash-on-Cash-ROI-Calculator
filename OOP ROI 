# ROI Calculator 
# Income- rental income + Laundry, storage and Misc. 

# Expenses -Tax, Insurance, Utilities, HOA, Lawn/Snow, Vacancy, Capital Expenditure
# Property Management, Mortgage

# Cash Flow- Income - expenses 

# Cash on Cash ROI = Total Annual Cash Flow / total investment 
# which is given as a percent and based on a year's worth of income'


# print("Let's find your cash on cash ROI for a rental property. Let's see if it's a good investment.  ")
# print("Lets get your income and your expenses to find your cashflow to finally find your cash on cash ROI")

# Idea for more complicated calculator involving user input 

# first make an income calulator by including rental income, laundry, storage and Misc. in a question when we run the program later on

#     def incomeCalc(self):
#         rent = int(input("How much do you make in rental income per year?"))
#         laund = int(input("and in laundry per month?"))
#         str_misc = int(input("Lastly, how much do you make in storage and misc. charges per month?"))
#         total_inc_pmonth = rent + laund + str_misc
#         total_inc_pyear = total_inc_pmonth * 12 
#         print(f" Your total income per month is {total_inc_pmonth} and per year is {total_inc_pyear}")



# def run():
#     while True:
#         response = input("What part would you like to add first? Income? Expenses? or Total Investment(TI)?")

#         if response.lower() == "income":
#             run incomeCalc(self)
